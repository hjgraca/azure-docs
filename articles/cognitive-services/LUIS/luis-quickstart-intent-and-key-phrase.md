# Quickstart: Create app that returns key subject matter found in utterances
In this quickstart, create an app that demonstrates how to extract key subject matter from utterances.

For this article, you can use the free [LUIS][LUIS] account in order to author your LUIS application.

## Key phrase extraction
Key subject matter is provided by the Prebuilt entity, **Key phrase**. This entity returns key subject matter in the utterance

The following utterances show examples of key phrases:

|Utterance|Key phrase|
|--|--|
|Is there a new medical plan with a lower deductible offered next year?|"lower deductible"<br>"new medical plan"<br>"year"|
|Is vision therapy covered in the high deductible medical plan?|"high deductible medical plan"<br>"vision therapy"|

Your chat bot can consider these values, in addition to all other entities extracted, when deciding the next step in the conversation.

## Download sample app
Download the [Human Resources](https://github.com/Microsoft/LUIS-Samples/blob/master/documentation-samples/quickstarts/HumanResources.json) app and save it to a file with the *.json extension. This sample app recognizes utterances relevant to employee benefits, organization charts, and physical assets.

## Create a new app
1. Log in to the [LUIS][LUIS] website. Make sure to log into the [region][LUIS-regions] where you need the LUIS endpoints published.

2. On the [LUIS][LUIS] website, select **Import new app** to import the Human Resources app downloaded in the previous section. 

    [![](media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-key-phrase/app-list.png "Screenshot of App lists page")](media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-key-phrase/app-list.png#lightbox)

3. On the **Import new app** dialog box, name the app `Human Resources with Key Phrase entity`.

    When the app creation process completes, LUIS displays the intents list.

## Add Key phrase entity 
Add Key phrase prebuilt entity to extract subject matter from utterances.

1. Select **Entities** from the left menu.

    [ ![Screenshot of Entities highlighted in left nav of Build section](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-key-phrase/select-entities.png)](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-key-phrase/select-entities.png#lightbox)

2. Select **Manage prebuilt entities**.

    [ ![Screenshot of Entities list pop-up dialog](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-key-phrase/manage-prebuilt-entities.png)](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-key-phrase/manage-prebuilt-entities.png#lightbox)

3. In the pop-up dialog, Select **keyPhrase**, then select **Done**. 

    [ ![Screenshot of Entities list pop-up dialog](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-key-phrase/add-or-remove-prebuilt-entities.png)](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-key-phrase/add-or-remove-prebuilt-entities.png#lightbox)

    <!-- TBD: asking Carol
    You won't see these entities labeled in utterances on the intents pages. 
    -->

## Train the LUIS app
LUIS doesn't know about this change to the model until it is trained. 

1. In the top right side of the LUIS website, select the **Train** button.

    ![Screenshot of Train button hightlighted](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-key-phrase/train-button-expanded.png)

2. Training is complete when you see the green status bar at the top of the website confirming success.

    ![Screenshot of Training success notification bar ](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-key-phrase/trained-inline.png)

## Publish app to endpoint

1. Select **Publish** in the top right navigation.

    ![Screenshot of Entity page with Publish button expanded ](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-key-phrase/publish-expanded.png)

2. Select the Production slot and the **Publish** button.

3. Publishing is complete when you see the green status bar at the top of the website confirming success.

## Query the endpoint with an utterance

1. On the **Publish** page, select the **endpoint** link at the bottom of the page. This action opens another browser window with the endpoint URL in the address bar. 

    ![Screenshot of Publish page with endpoint url highlighted](media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-key-phrase/endpoint-url-inline.png )

2. Go to the end of the URL in the address and enter `Is there a new medical plan with a lower deductible offered next year?`. The last querystring parameter is `q`, the utterance **query**. 

```
{
  "query": "Is there a new medical plan with a lower deductible offered next year?",
  "topScoringIntent": {
    "intent": "FindForm",
    "score": 0.216838628
  },
  "entities": [
    {
      "entity": "lower deductible",
      "type": "builtin.keyPhrase",
      "startIndex": 35,
      "endIndex": 50
    },
    {
      "entity": "new medical plan",
      "type": "builtin.keyPhrase",
      "startIndex": 11,
      "endIndex": 26
    },
    {
      "entity": "year",
      "type": "builtin.keyPhrase",
      "startIndex": 65,
      "endIndex": 68
    }
  ]
}
```

## What has this LUIS app accomplished?
This app, with keyPhrase entity detection, identified a natural language query intention and returned the extracted data including the main subject matter. 

Your chat bot now has enough information to determine the next step in the conversation. 

## Where is this LUIS data used? 
LUIS is done with this request. The calling application, such as a chat bot, can take the topScoringIntent result and the keyPhrase data from the utterance to take the next step. LUIS doesn't do that programmatic work for the bot or calling application. LUIS only determines what the user's intention is. 

## Clean up resources
When no longer needed, delete the LUIS app. To do so, select the three dot menu (...) to the right of the app name in the app list, select **Delete**. On the pop-up dialog **Delete app?**, select **Ok**.
