# Prepare to use Speech service

In this article, you learn how to set up your development environment to use Speech service.

## Where do I begin?

* First, sign up for a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) if you don't already have one.

* Next, get a free trial of the Speech service through [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/). You'll get access to two subscription keys that you can use to get started. You can use either to get started.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > When your trial subscription expires, you can sign up for a paid subscription through your Azure dashboard.

* Finally, download the relevant SDK and sample code to play around with.

    * To download an SDK, see [Speech SDKs](speech-sdk.md).
    * To access some sample code, see [Sample code](samples.md).

## Next steps
