# Copy data from Azure Database for PostgreSQL using Azure Data Factory 

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from Azure Database for PostgreSQL. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to version 2 of Data Factory, which is currently in preview. If you are using version 1 of the Data Factory service, which is generally available (GA), see [Copy Activity in V1](v1/data-factory-data-movement-activities.md).

## Supported capabilities

You can copy data from Azure Database for PostgreSQL to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Azure Data Factory provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Azure Database for PostgreSQL connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Azure Database for PostgreSQL linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **AzurePostgreSql** | Yes |
| connectionString | An ODBC connection string to connect to Azure Database for PostgreSQL. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| connectVia | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. You can use Azure Integration Runtime or Self-hosted Integration Runtime (if your data store is located in private network). If not specified, it uses the default Azure Integration Runtime. |No |

A typical connection string is `Server=<server>.postgres.database.azure.com;Database=<database>;Port=<port>;UID=<username>@admstest;Password=<Password>`. More properties you can set per your case:

| Property | Description | Options | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| EncryptionMethod (EM)| The method the driver uses to encrypt data sent between the driver and the database server. E.g. `ValidateServerCertificate=<0/1/6>;`| 0 (No Encryption) **(Default)** / 1 (SSL) / 6 (RequestSSL) | No |
| ValidateServerCertificate (VSC) | Determines whether the driver validates the certificate that is sent by the database server when SSL encryption is enabled (Encryption Method=1). E.g. `ValidateServerCertificate=<0/1>;`| 0 (Disabled) **(Default)** / 1 (Enabled) | No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "AzurePostgreSqlLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "AzurePostgreSql",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": {
                 "type": "SecureString",
                 "value": "Server=<server>.postgres.database.azure.com;Database=<database>;Port=<port>;UID=<username>@admstest;Password=<Password>"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Azure Database for PostgreSQL dataset.

To copy data from Azure Database for PostgreSQL, set the type property of the dataset to **AzurePostgreSqlTable**. There is no additional type-specific property in this type of dataset.

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "AzurePostgreSqlDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "AzurePostgreSqlTable",
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<AzurePostgreSql linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Azure Database for PostgreSQL source.

### AzurePostgreSqlSource as source

To copy data from Azure Database for PostgreSQL, set the source type in the copy activity to **AzurePostgreSqlSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **AzurePostgreSqlSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM MyTable"`. | Yes |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromAzurePostgreSql",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<AzurePostgreSql input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "AzurePostgreSqlSource",
                "query": "<custom query e.g. SELECT * FROM MyTable>"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```
