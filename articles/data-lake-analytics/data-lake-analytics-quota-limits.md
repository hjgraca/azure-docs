# Azure Data Lake Analytics Quota Limits

Learn how to adjust and increase quota limits in Azure Data Lake Analytics (ADLA) accounts. Knowing these limits may help you understand your U-SQL job behavior. All quota limits are soft, so you can increase the maximum limits by contacting Azure support.

## Azure subscriptions limits

**Maximum number of ADLA accounts per subscription per region:**  5

If you try to create a sixth ADLA account, you will get an error "You have reached the maximum number of Data Lake Analytics accounts allowed (5) in region under subscription name". 

If you want to go beyond this limit, you can try these options:
* choose another region if suitable
* contact Azure support by [opening a support ticket](#increase-maximum-quota-limits) to request a quota increase.

## ADLA account limits

**Maximum number of Analytics Units (AUs) per account:** 250

This is the maximum number of AUs that can run concurrently in your account. If your total number of running AUs across all jobs exceeds this limit, newer jobs are queued automatically. For example:

* If you have only one job running with 250 AUs, when you submit a second job it will wait in the job queue until the first job completes.
* If you already have five jobs running and each is using 50 AUs, when you submit a sixth job that needs 20 AUs it waits in the job queue until there are 20 AUs available.

**Maximum number of concurrent U-SQL jobs per account:** 20

This is the maximum number of jobs that can run concurrently in your account. Above this value, newer jobs are queued automatically.

## Adjust ADLA quota limits per account

1. Sign on to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Choose an existing ADLA account.
3. Click **Properties**.
4. Adjust **Parallelism** and **Concurrent Jobs** to suit your needs.
