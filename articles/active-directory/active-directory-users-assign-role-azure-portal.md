# Assign a user to administrator roles in Azure Active Directory
This article explains how to assign an administrative role to a user in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). For information about adding new users in your organization, see [Add new users to Azure Active Directory](active-directory-users-create-azure-portal.md). Added users don't have administrator permissions by default, but you can assign roles to them at any time.

## Assign a role to a user
1. Sign in to the [Azure AD admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com) with an account that's a global admin for the directory.
2. Select **Users and groups**.

3. Select **All users**.

4. Select a user from the list.
5. For the selected user, select **Directory role** and then assign the user to a role from the **Directory role** list. For more information about user and administrator roles, see [Assigning administrator roles in Azure AD](active-directory-assign-admin-roles-azure-portal.md).
