# Use Helm with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

[Helm][helm] is an open-source packaging tool that helps you install and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes applications. Similar to Linux package managers such as *APT* and *Yum*, Helm is used to manage Kubernetes charts, which are packages of preconfigured Kubernetes resources.

This document steps through configuring and using Helm in a Kubernetes cluster on AKS.

## Before you begin

The steps detailed in this document assume that you have created an AKS cluster and have established a kubectl connection with the cluster. If you need these items see, the [AKS quickstart][aks-quickstart].

## Install Helm CLI

The Helm CLI is a client that runs on your development system and allows you to start, stop, and manage applications with Helm charts.

If you're using Azure CloudShell, the Helm CLI is already installed. To install the Helm CLI on a Mac use `brew`. For additional installation options see, [Installing Helm][helm-install-options].

```console
brew install kubernetes-helm
```

Output:

```

==> Summary

```

## Configure Helm

The [helm init][helm-init] command is used to install Helm components in a Kubernetes cluster and make client-side configurations. Run the following command to install Helm on your AKS cluster and configure the Helm client.

```azurecli-interactive
helm init --upgrade --service-account default
```

Output:

```
$HELM_HOME has been configured at /Users/neilpeterson/.helm.

Tiller (the Helm server-side component) has been installed into your Kubernetes Cluster.

Please note: by default, Tiller is deployed with an insecure 'allow unauthenticated users' policy.
For more information on securing your installation see: https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#securing-your-helm-installation
Happy Helming!
```

## Find Helm charts

Helm charts are used to deploy applications into a Kubernetes cluster. To search for pre-created Helm charts, use the [helm search][helm-search] command.

```azurecli-interactive
helm search
```

The output looks similar to the following, however with many more charts.

```

...
```

To update the list of charts, use the [helm repo update][helm-repo-update] command.

```azurecli-interactive
helm repo update
```

Output:

```
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Skip local chart repository
...Successfully got an update from the "stable" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈ Happy Helming!⎈
```

## Run Helm charts

To deploy an NGINX ingress controller, use the [helm install][helm-install] command.

```azurecli-interactive
helm install stable/nginx-ingress --set rbac.create=false --set rbac.createRole=false --set rbac.createClusterRole=false
```

The output looks similar to the following, but includes additional information such as instructions on how to use the Kubernetes deployment.

```

...
```

For more information on using an NGINX ingress controller with Kubernetes, see [NGINX Ingress Controller][nginx-ingress].

## List Helm charts

To see a list of charts installed on your cluster, use the [helm list][helm-list] command.

```azurecli-interactive
helm list
```

Output:

```
NAME         	REVISION	UPDATED                 	STATUS  	CHART              	NAMESPACE
bilging-ant  	1       	Thu Oct  5 00:11:11 2017	DEPLOYED	nginx-ingress-0.8.7	default
```
