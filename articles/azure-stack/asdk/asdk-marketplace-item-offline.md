# Tutorial: add an Azure Stack marketplace item from a local source

As an Azure Stack Operator, the first thing you need to do to enable users to deploy a Virtual Machine (VM) is to add a VM image to the Azure Stack marketplace. By default, nothing is published to the Azure Stack marketplace, but you can upload VM ISO images to make them available to your users. Use this option if you have deployed Azure Stack in a disconnected scenario or in scenarios with limited connectivity.

In this tutorial, you download a Windows Server 2016 VM image from the the Windows Server Evaluations page and upload it to the Azure Stack marketplace.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> * Add a Windows Server 2016 VM image
> * Verify the VM image is available 
> * Test the VM image

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial:

- Install the [Azure Stack-compatible Azure PowerShell modules](asdk-post-deploy.md#install-azure-stack-powershell)
- Download the [Azure Stack tools](asdk-post-deploy.md#download-the-azure-stack-tools)
- Download the [Windows Server 2106 virtual machine ISO image](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2016) from the Windows Server Evaluations page

## Add a Windows Server VM image
You can publish the Windows Server 2016 image to the Azure Stack marketplace by adding a previously downloaded ISO image using PowerShell. 

Use this option if you have deployed Azure Stack in a disconnected scenario or in scenarios with limited connectivity.

1. Import the Azure Stack `Connect` and `ComputeAdmin` PowerShell modules included in the Azure Stack tools directory by using the following commands:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

   # Import the Connect and ComputeAdmin modules.   
   Import-Module .\Connect\AzureStack.Connect.psm1
   Import-Module .\ComputeAdmin\AzureStack.ComputeAdmin.psm1

   ```

2. Run one of the following scripts on to your ASDK host computer depending on whether you deployed your Azure Stack environment by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS):

  - Commands for **Azure AD deployments**: 

      ```PowerShell
      # To get this value for Azure Stack integrated systems, contact your service provider.
      $ArmEndpoint = "https://adminmanagement.local.azurestack.external"

      # To get this value for Azure Stack integrated systems, contact your service provider.
      $GraphAudience = "https://graph.windows.net/"
      
      # Create the Azure Stack operator's Azure Resource Manager environment by using the following cmdlet:
      Add-AzureRMEnvironment `
        -Name "AzureStackAdmin" `
        -ArmEndpoint $ArmEndpoint

      Set-AzureRmEnvironment `
        -Name "AzureStackAdmin" `
        -GraphAudience $GraphAudience

      $TenantID = Get-AzsDirectoryTenantId `
      # Replace the AADTenantName value to reflect your Azure AD tenant name.
        -AADTenantName "<myDirectoryTenantName>.onmicrosoft.com" `
        -EnvironmentName AzureStackAdmin

      Add-AzureRmAccount `
        -EnvironmentName "AzureStackAdmin" `
        -TenantId $TenantID 
      ```

  - Commands for **AD FS deployments**:
      
      ```PowerShell
      # To get this value for Azure Stack integrated systems, contact your service provider.
      $ArmEndpoint = "https://adminmanagement.local.azurestack.external"

      # To get this value for Azure Stack integrated systems, contact your service provider.
      $GraphAudience = "https://graph.local.azurestack.external/"

      # Create the Azure Stack operator's Azure Resource Manager environment by using the following cmdlet:
      Add-AzureRMEnvironment `
        -Name "AzureStackAdmin" `
        -ArmEndpoint $ArmEndpoint

      Set-AzureRmEnvironment `
        -Name "AzureStackAdmin" `
        -GraphAudience $GraphAudience `
        -EnableAdfsAuthentication:$true

      $TenantID = Get-AzsDirectoryTenantId `
      -ADFS `
      -EnvironmentName "AzureStackAdmin" 

      Add-AzureRmAccount `
        -EnvironmentName "AzureStackAdmin" `
        -TenantId $TenantID 
      ```
   
3. Add the Windows Server 2016 image to the Azure Stack marketplace. (Replace *fully_qualified_path_to_ISO* with the path to the Windows Server 2016 ISO that you downloaded.)

    ```PowerShell
    $ISOPath = "<fully_qualified_path_to_ISO>"

    # Add a Windows Server 2016 Evaluation VM image.
    New-AzsServer2016VMImage `
      -ISOPath $ISOPath

    ```

## Verify the marketplace item is available
Use these steps to verify that the new VM image is available in the Azure Stack marketplace.

1. Sign in to the [ASDK admin portal](https://adminportal.local.azurestack.external).

2. Select **More services** > **Marketplace Management**. 

3. Verify that the Windows Server 2016 Datacenter VM image has been added successfully.

## Test the VM image
As an Azure Stack operator, you can use the [administrator portal](https://adminportal.local.azurestack.external) to create a test VM to validate the image has been made available successfully. 

1. Sign in to the [ASDK admin portal](https://adminportal.local.azurestack.external).

2. Click **New** > **Compute** > **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter** > **Create**.  
 ![Create VM from marketplace image](media/asdk-marketplace-item/new-compute.png)

3. In the **Basics** blade, enter the following information and then click **OK**:
  - **Name**: test-vm-1
  - **User name**: AdminTestUser
  - **Password**: AzS-TestVM01
  - **Subscription**: Accept the Default Provider Subscription
  - **Resource group**: test-vm-rg
  - **Location**: local

4. In the **Choose a size** blade, click **A1 Standard**, and then click **Select**.  

5. In the **Settings** blade, accept the defaults and click **OK**

6. In the **Summary** blade, click **OK** to create the virtual machine.  
> [!NOTE]
> The virtual machine deployment takes a few minutes to complete.

7. To view to the new VM, click **Virtual machines**, then search for **test-vm-1** and click its name.

## Clean up resources
After you have successfully signed in to the VM, and verified that the test image is working properly, you should delete the test resource group. This will free up limited resources available to single-node ASDK installations.

When no longer needed, delete the resource group, VM, and all related resources by following these steps:

1. Sign in to the [ASDK admin portal](https://adminportal.local.azurestack.external).
2. Click **Resource groups** > **test-vm-rg** > **Delete resource group**.
3. Type **test-vm-rg** as the resource group name and then click **Delete**.
