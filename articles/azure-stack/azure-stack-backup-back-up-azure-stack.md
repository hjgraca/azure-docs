# Back up Azure Stack

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

Perform an on-demand backup on Azure Stack with backup in place. If you need to enable the Infrastructure Backup Service, see [Enable Backup for Azure Stack from the administration portal](azure-stack-backup-enable-backup-console.md).

> [!Note]  
>  For instructions on configuring the PowerShell environment, see [Install PowerShell for Azure Stack ](azure-stack-powershell-install.md).

## Start Azure Stack backup

Open Windows PowerShell with an elevated prompt in the operator management environment, and run the following commands:

```powershell
    Start-AzSBackup -Location $location.Name
```

## Confirm backup completed in the administration portal

1. Open the Azure Stack administration portal at [https://adminportal.local.azurestack.external](https://adminportal.local.azurestack.external).
2. Select **More services** > **Infrastructure backup**. Choose **Configuration** in the **Infrastructure backup** blade.
3. Find the **Name** and **Date Completed** of the backup in **Available backups** list.
4. Verify the **State** is **Succeeded**.

<!-- You can also confirm the backup completed from the administration portal. Navigate to `\MASBackup\<datetime>\<backupid>\BackupInfo.xml`

In ‘Confirm backup completed’ section, the path at the end doesn’t make sense (ie relative to what, datetime format, etc?)
\MASBackup\<datetime>\<backupid>\BackupInfo.xml -->
