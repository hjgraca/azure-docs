# Application Insights Overview dashboard (preview)

Application Insights has always provided a summary overview pane to allow quick, at-a-glance assessment of your application's health and performance. The new preview overview dashboard provides a faster more flexible experience.

## How do I test out the new experience?

 In Application Insights under: _Investigate_ select _Overview (preview)_.

This will launch the new default overview dashboard:

## Better performance

Time range selection has been simplified to a simple one-click interface.

Overall performance has been greatly increased. Each default dynamically updating KPI tile is linked to the corresponding Application Insights feature. For example, selecting failed requests will launch the _Failures_ pane:

## Application dashboard

Application dashboard leverages the existing dashboard technology within Azure to provide a fully customizable single pane view of your application health and performance.

To access the default dashboard select _Application Dashboard_ in the upper left corner.

While you can keep the default view if you like it, you can also add, and delete from the dashboard to best fit the needs of your team.

To navigate back to the overview experience just select:
