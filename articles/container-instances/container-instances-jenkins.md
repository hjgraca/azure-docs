# Use Azure Container Instances as a Jenkins build agent

Azure container instances provide an on-demand, burstable, and isolated environment for running containerized workload. Because of these attributes, Azure container instances make a great platform for running Jenkins build jobs at a large scale. This document walks through deploying and using a Jenkins server that is pre-configured with ACI as a build target.

For more information on Azure Container Instances, see [About Azure Container Instances][about-aci].

## Deploy Jenkins server

In the Azure portal, select **Create a resource** and search for **Jenkins**. Select the Jenkins offering with a publisher of **Microsoft** and select **Create**.

Enter the following information on the basics form and click **OK** when done.

- **Name** - name for the Jenkins deployment.
- **User name** - this user name is used as the admin user for the Jenkins virtual machine.
- **Authentication type** - SSH public key is recommended. If selected, copy in an SSH public key to be used when logging into the Jenkins virtual machine.
- **Subscription** - select an Azure subscription.
- **Resource group** - create a new or select an existing resource group.
- **Location** - select a location for the Jenkins server.

On the additional settings form, complete the following items:

- **Size** - Select the appropriate sizing option for your Jenkins virtual machine.
- **VM disk type** - Specify either HDD (hard-disk drive) or SSD (solid-state drive) for the Jenkins server.
- **Virtual network** - (Optional) Select Virtual network to modify the default settings.
- **Subnets** - Select Subnets, verify the information, and select **OK**.
- **Public IP address** - Selecting the Public IP address allows you to give it a custom name, configure SKU, and assignment method.
- **Domain name label** - Specify a value to create a fully qualified URL to the Jenkins virtual machine.
- **Jenkins release type** - Select the desired release type from the options: LTS, Weekly build, or Azure Verified.

For service principal integration, select **Auto(MSI)** to have [Azure Managed Service Identity][managed-service-identity] auto create an authentication identity for the Jenkins instance. Select Manual to provider your own service principal credentials.

Cloud agents configure a cloud-based platform for Jenkins build jobs. For the sake of this document, select ACI. With the ACI cloud agent, each Jenkins build job is run in an Azure Container Instance.

Once done with the integration settings, click **OK**, and then **OK** again on the validation summary. Click **Create** on the Terms of use summary. The Jenkins server takes a few minutes to deploy.

## Configure Jenkins

In the Azure portal, browse to the Jenkins Resource Group, select the Jenkins virtual machine, and take note of the DNS name.

![Jenkins login instructions](./media/container-instances-jenkins/jenkins-portal-fqdn.png)

Browser to the DNS name of the Jenkins VM and copy the returned SSH string.

![Jenkins login instructions](./media/container-instances-jenkins/jenkins-portal-04.png)

Open up a terminal session on your development system, and paste in the SSH string from the last step. Update 'username' to the username specified when deploying the Jenkins server.

Once connected, run the following command to retrieve the initial admin password.

```
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

Leave the SSH session and tunnel running, and navigate to http://localhost:8080 in a browser. Paste the initial admin password into the field as seen in the following image. Select **Continue** when done.

Select **Install suggested plugins** to install all recommended Jenkins plugins.

![Install Jenkins plugin](./media/container-instances-jenkins/jenkins-portal-06.png)

Create a new admin user account. This account is used for logging into and working with your Jenkins instance.

![Create Jenkins user](./media/container-instances-jenkins/jenkins-portal-07.png)

Select **Save and Finish** when done, and then **Start using Jenkins** to complete the configuration.

Jenkins is now configured and ready to build and deploy code. For this example, a simple Java application is used to demonstrate a Jenkins build on Azure Container Instances.

## Create build job

When using a container image as a Jenkins build target, you need to specify an image that includes all tooling necessary for a successful build. To specify the image, select **Manage Jenkins** > **Configure System** and scroll down to the **Cloud** section. For this example, update the Docker image value to `microsoft/java-on-azure-jenkins-slave`.

Once done, click **Save** to return to the Jenkins dashboard.

![Jenkins cloud configuration](./media/container-instances-jenkins/jenkins-aci-image.png)

Now create a Jenkins build job. Select **New Item**, give the build project a name such as `aci-java-demo`, select **Freestyle project**, and click **OK**.

![Create Jenkins job](./media/container-instances-jenkins/jenkins-new-job.png)

Under **General**, ensure that **Restrict where this project can be run** is selected. Enter `linux` for the Label Expression. This configuration ensures that this build job runs on the ACI cloud.

![Create Jenkins job](./media/container-instances-jenkins/jenkins-job-01.png)

Under source code management, select `Git` and enter `https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git` for the repository URL. This GitHub repo contains the sample application code.

![Add source code to Jenkins job](./media/container-instances-jenkins/jenkins-job-02.png)

Under Build, select **add a build step** and select `Invoke top-level Maven targets`. Enter `package` as the build step goal.

![Add Jenkins build step](./media/container-instances-jenkins/jenkins-job-03.png)

Select **Save** when done.

## Run the build job

To test the build job and observe Azure Container Instances as the build platform, manually start a build.

Select **Build Now** to start a build job. It takes a few minutes for the job to start, when running, you should see status similar to the following images.

![Add Jenkins build step](./media/container-instances-jenkins/jenkins-job-status.png)

While the job is running, open up the Azure portal and look at the Jenkins resource group. You should see that an Azure Container Instance has been created. It is inside this instance that the Jenkins job is running.

![Jenkins builds in ACI](./media/container-instances-jenkins/jenkins-aci.png)

As Jenkins runs more jobs than the configured number of Jenkins executors (default 2), multiple Azure Container Instances are created.

Once all build jobs have been completed, the Azure container instances are removed.
