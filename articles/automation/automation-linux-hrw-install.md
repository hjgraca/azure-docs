# How to deploy a Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker

The Hybrid Runbook Worker feature of Azure Automation allows you to run runbooks directly on the computer hosting the role and against resources in the environment to manage those local resources. The Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker executes runbooks as a special user which can be elevated for running commands that need elevation. Runbooks are stored and managed in Azure Automation and then delivered to one or more designated computers. This article decribes how to install the Hybrid Runbook Worker on a Linux machine.

## Supported Linux Operating Systems

The following is a list of Linux distributions that are supported:

* Amazon Linux 2012.09 --> 2015.09 (x86/x64)
* CentOS Linux 5, 6, and 7 (x86/x64)
* Oracle Linux 5, 6, and 7 (x86/x64)
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 5,6 and 7 (x86/x64)
* Debian GNU/Linux 6, 7, and 8 (x86/x64)
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 14.04 LTS, 16.04 LTS (x86/x64)
* SUSE Linux Enteprise Server 11 and 12 (x86/x64)

## Installing Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker

To install and configure a Hybrid Runbook Worker on your Linux computer, you follow a straight forward process to manually install and configure the role. It requires enabling the **Automation Hybrid Worker** solution in your Log Analytics workspace and then running a set of commands to register the computer as a worker and add it to a new or existing group.

The following are the minimum requirements for a Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker:

* A minimum of two cores
* A minimum of 4 GB of RAM
* Port 443 (outbound)

### Package requirements

| **Required package** | **Description** | **Minimum version**|
|--------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------|
|Glibc |GNU C Library| 2.5-12 |
|Openssl| OpenSSL Libraries | 0.9.8e or 1.0|
|Curl | cURL web client | 7.15.5|
|Python-ctypes | |
|PAM | Pluggable Authentication Modules|

Before you proceed, you need to note the Log Analytics workspace your Automation account is linked to and also the primary key for your Automation account. You can find both from the portal by selecting your Automation account, and selecting **Workspace** for the Workspace ID, and selecting **Keys** for the primary key. For information on ports and addresses that are needed for the Hybrid Runbook Worker, see [Configuring your network](automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md#network-planning).

1. Enable the "Automation Hybrid Worker" solution in Azure. This can be done by either:

   1. Add the **Automation Hybrid Worker** solution to your subscription using the procedure at [Add Log Analytics management solutions to your workspace](../log-analytics/log-analytics-add-solutions.md).
   1. Run the following cmdlet:

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
         Set-AzureRmOperationalInsightsIntelligencePack -ResourceGroupName  <ResourceGroupName> -WorkspaceName <WorkspaceName> -IntelligencePackName  "AzureAutomation" -Enabled $true
        ```

1. Install the OMS agent for Linux by running the following command, replacing \<WorkspaceID\> and \<WorkspaceKey\> with the appropriate values from your workspace.

   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/master/installer/scripts/onboard_agent.sh && sh onboard_agent.sh -w <WorkspaceID> -s <WorkspaceKey>
   ```

1. Run the following command, changing the values for parameters *-w*, *-k*, *-g*, and *-e*. For the *-g* parameter, replace the value with the name of the Hybrid Runbook Worker group that the new Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker should join. If the name does not exist already in your Automation account, a new Hybrid Runbook Worker group is made with that name.

   ```bash
   sudo python /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/modules/nxOMSAutomationWorker/DSCResources/MSFT_nxOMSAutomationWorkerResource/automationworker/scripts/onboarding.py --register -w <LogAnalyticsworkspaceId> -k <AutomationSharedKey> -g <hybridgroupname> -e <automationendpoint>
   ```

1. After the command is complete, the Hybrid Worker Groups page in the Azure portal will show the new group and number of members or if an existing group, the number of members is incremented. You can select the group from the list on the **Hybrid Worker Groups** page and select the **Hybrid Workers** tile. On the **Hybrid Workers** page, you see each member of the group listed.

## Turning off signature validation

By default, Linux Hybrid Runbook Workers require signature validation. If you run an unsigned runbook against a worker, you see an error containing "Signature validation failed". To turn off signature validation, run the following command, replacing the second parameter with your Log Analytics workspace ID:

 ```bash
 sudo python /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/modules/nxOMSAutomationWorker/DSCResources/MSFT_nxOMSAutomationWorkerResource/automationworker/scripts/require_runbook_signature.py --false <LogAnalyticsworkspaceId>
 ```

## Supported runbook types

Linux Hybrid Runbook Workers do not support the full set of runbook types that are found within Azure automation.

The following runbook types work on a Linux Hybrid Worker:

* Python 2
* PowerShell

The following runbook types do not work on a Linux Hybrid Worker:

* PowerShell Workflow
* Graphical
* Graphical PowerShell Workflow

## Troubleshooting

The Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker depends on the OMS Agent for Linux to communicate with your Automation account to register the worker, receive runbook jobs, and report status. If registration of the worker fails, here are some possible causes for the error:

### The OMS Agent for Linux is not running

If the OMS Agent for Linux is not running, this prevents the Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker from communicating with Azure Automation. Verify the agent is running by entering the following command: `ps -ef | grep python`. You should see output similar to the following, the python processes with **nxautomation** user account. If the Update Management or Azure Automation solutions are not enabled, none of the following processes will be running.

```bash
nxautom+   8567      1  0 14:45 ?        00:00:00 python /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/modules/nxOMSAutomationWorker/DSCResources/MSFT_nxOMSAutomationWorkerResource/automationworker/worker/main.py /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/state/automationworker/oms.conf rworkspace:<workspaceId> <Linux hybrid worker version>
nxautom+   8593      1  0 14:45 ?        00:00:02 python /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/modules/nxOMSAutomationWorker/DSCResources/MSFT_nxOMSAutomationWorkerResource/automationworker/worker/hybridworker.py /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/state/automationworker/worker.conf managed rworkspace:<workspaceId> rversion:<Linux hybrid worker version>
nxautom+   8595      1  0 14:45 ?        00:00:02 python /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/modules/nxOMSAutomationWorker/DSCResources/MSFT_nxOMSAutomationWorkerResource/automationworker/worker/hybridworker.py /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/<workspaceId>/state/automationworker/diy/worker.conf managed rworkspace:<workspaceId> rversion:<Linux hybrid worker version>
```

The following list shows the processes that are started for a Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker. They are all located in the `/var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/state/automationworker/` directory.

* **oms.conf** - This is the worker manager process, this is started directly from DSC.

* **worker.conf** - This process is the Auto Registered Hybrid worker process, it is started by the worker manager. This process is used by Update Management and is transparent to the user. This process is not be present if the Update Management solution is not enabled on the machine.

* **diy/worker.conf** - This process is the DIY hybrid worker process. The DIY hybrid worker process is used to execute user runbooks on the Hybrid Runbook Worker. It only differs from the Auto registered Hybrid worker process in the key detail that is uses a different configuration. This process is not be present if the Azure Automation solution is not enabled, and the DIY Linux Hybrid Worker is not registered.

If the OMS Agent for Linux is not running, run the following command to start the service: `sudo /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart`.

### The specified class does not exist

If you see the error **The specified class does not exists..** in the  `/var/opt/microsoft/omsconfig/omsconfig.log` then the OMS Agent for Linux needs to be updated. Run the following command to re-install the OMS Agent:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/master/installer/scripts/onboard_agent.sh && sh onboard_agent.sh -w <WorkspaceID> -s <WorkspaceKey>
```
