## IoT solution accelerator cipher suites

The IoT solution accelerators support the following Cipher Suites, in this order.

| Cipher Suite | Length |
| --- | --- |
| TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_CBC\_SHA384 (0xc028) ECDH secp384r1 (eq. 7680 bits RSA) FS |256 |
| TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA256 (0xc027) ECDH secp256r1 (eq. 3072 bits RSA) FS |128 |
| TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_CBC\_SHA (0xc014) ECDH secp384r1 (eq. 7680 bits RSA) FS |256 |
| TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA (0xc013) ECDH secp256r1 (eq. 3072 bits RSA) FS |128 |
| TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_GCM\_SHA384 (0x9d) |256 |
| TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_GCM\_SHA256 (0x9c) |128 |
| TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_CBC\_SHA256 (0x3d) |256 |
| TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA256 (0x3c) |128 |
