# Preview: Create a Java web app in App Service on Linux

App Service on Linux currently provides a preview feature to support Java web apps. Please review the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for more information on previews. [Deploying Java web apps to a Linux container in the cloud using the Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/azure/intellij/azure-toolkit-for-intellij-hello-world-web-app-linux) is an alternative approach to deploy your Java app to your own container.

> [!NOTE]
> This article deploys a Java web app to App Service on Linux.

[App Service on Linux](app-service-linux-intro.md) provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service using the Linux operating system. This quickstart shows how to deploy a Java app to App Service on Linux using a built-in image. You create the web app with built-in image using the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli), and you deploy the Java app to the web app.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]


## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart: 

* You must have an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.
* [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/).
* Install [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).



[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Configure deployment user](../../../includes/configure-deployment-user.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Create resource group](../../../includes/app-service-web-create-resource-group-linux.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Create app service plan](../../../includes/app-service-web-create-app-service-plan-linux.md)]


## Create a web app

In the Cloud Shell, create a [web app](../app-service-web-overview.md) in the `myAppServicePlan` App Service plan. You can do it by using the [`az webapp create`](/cli/azure/webapp?view=azure-cli-latest#az_webapp_create) command. In the following example, replace *\<app_name>* with a globally unique app name (valid characters are `a-z`, `0-9`, and `-`). 

```azurecli-interactive
# Bash
az webapp create --name <app_name> --resource-group myResourceGroup --plan myAppServicePlan --runtime "TOMCAT|8.5-jre8"
# PowerShell
az --% webapp create --name <app_name> --resource-group myResourceGroup --plan myAppServicePlan --runtime "TOMCAT|8.5-jre8"
```

For the **runtime** parameter, use one of the following runtimes:
 * TOMCAT|8.5-jre8
 * TOMCAT|9.0-jre8


When the web app has been created, the Azure CLI shows information similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "additionalProperties": {},
  "availabilityState": "Normal",
  "clientAffinityEnabled": true,
  "clientCertEnabled": false,
  "cloningInfo": null,
  "containerSize": 0,
  "dailyMemoryTimeQuota": 0,
  "defaultHostName": "<your web app name>.azurewebsites.net",
  "enabled": true,
  "enabledHostNames": [
    "<your web app name>.azurewebsites.net",
    "<your web app name>.scm.azurewebsites.net"
  ],
  "ftpPublishingUrl": "ftp://<your ftp URL>",  
  < JSON data removed for brevity. >
}
```

Copy the value for **ftpPublishingUrl**. You will use this later, if you choose FTP deployment.

Browse to the newly created web app.

```
http://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net
```

If the web app is up and running, you should get a default screen similar to the following image:

## Download the sample Java app

In a terminal window on your machine, run the following command to clone the sample app repository to your local machine. You will deploy this sample app in a later step.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-docs-hello-world
```


## Deploying the Java app to App Service on Linux

Open the sample project in [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), and [export the java app to a Web Archive (WAR) file](http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.wst.webtools.doc.user%2Ftopics%2Ftwcrewar.html) named `helloworld.war`.

To deploy your Java app WAR file, you can use WarDeploy (currently in [Preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/)), or FTP.

Depending on which method of deployment you use, the relative path to browse to your Java web app will be slightly different.

### Deploy with WarDeploy 

To deploy your WAR file with WarDeploy, use the following cURL example commandline to send a POST request to *https://<your app name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/wardeploy*. The POST request must contain the .war file in the message body. The deployment credentials for your app are provided in the request by using HTTP BASIC authentication. For more information on WarDeploy, see [Deploy your app to Azure App Service with a ZIP or WAR file](../app-service-deploy-zip.md).

```bash
curl -X POST -u <username> --data-binary @"<war_file_path>" https://<app_name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/wardeploy
```

Update the following:

* `username` - Use the deployment credential username you created earlier.
* `war_file_path` - Use the local WAR file path.
* `app_name` - Use the app name your created earlier.

Execute the command. When prompted by cURL, type in the password for your deployment credentials.

Browse to the deployed application using the following URL in your web browser.

```bash
http://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net
```

The Java sample code is running in a web app with built-in image.

![Sample app running in Azure](media/quickstart-java/java-hello-world-in-browser.png)

Browse to the servlet using your web browser.

```bash
http://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net/HelloWorldServlet
```

The servlet is running in a web app with built-in image.

**Congratulations!** You've deployed your first Java app to App Service on Linux.



### FTP deployment

Alternatively, you can also use FTP to deploy the WAR file. 

FTP the file to the */home/site/wwwroot/webapps* directory of your web app. The following example commandline uses cURL:

```bash
curl -T war_file_path -u "app_name\username" ftp://webappFTPURL/site/wwwroot/webapps/
```

Update the following:

* `war_file_path` - Use the local WAR file path.
* `app_name` - Use the app name your created earlier.
* `username` - Use the deployment credential username you created earlier.
* `webappFTPURL` - Use the **FTP hostname** value for your web app which you copied earlier. The FTP hostname is also listed on **Overview** blade for your web app in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

Execute the command. When prompted by cURL, type in the password for your deployment credentials.


Browse to the deployed application using the following URL in your web browser.

```bash
http://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net/helloworld
```

The Java sample code is running in a web app with built-in image.

Browse to the servlet using your web browser.

```bash

```
