# Routing messages with IoT Hub (Node)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-selector-process-d2c](../../includes/iot-hub-selector-process-d2c.md)]

This tutorial builds on the [Get started with IoT Hub] tutorial.  The tutorial:

* Shows you how to use routing rules to dispatch device-to-cloud messages in an easy, configuration-based way.
* Illustrates how to isolate interactive messages that require immediate action from the solution back end for further processing.  For example, a device might send an alarm message that triggers inserting a ticket into a CRM system.  In contrast, data-point messages, such as temperature telemetry, feed into an analytics engine.

At the end of this tutorial, you run three Node.js console apps:

* **SimulatedDevice.js**, a modified version of the app created in the [Get started with IoT Hub] tutorial, sends data-point device-to-cloud messages every second, and interactive device-to-cloud messages per random interval. This app uses the MQTT protocol to communicate with IoT Hub.
* **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages.js** displays the telemetry sent by your device app.
* **ReadCriticalQueue.js** de-queues the critical messages from the Service Bus queue attached to the IoT hub.

> [!NOTE]
> IoT Hub has SDK support for many device platforms and languages, including C, Java, and JavaScript. For instructions on how to replace the device in this tutorial with a physical device, and how to connect devices to an IoT Hub, see the [Azure IoT Developer Center].

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* A complete working version of the [Get started with IoT Hub] tutorial.
* Node.js version 4.0.x or later.
* An active Azure account. (If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account][lnk-free-trial] in just a couple of minutes.)

We also recommend reading about [Azure Storage] and [Azure Service Bus].

## Send interactive messages from a device app
In this section, you modify the device app you created in the [Get started with IoT Hub] tutorial to occasionally send messages that require immediate processing.

1. Use a text editor to open the **simulateddevice\SimulatedDevice.js** file. This file contains the code for the **SimulatedDevice** app you created in the [Get started with IoT Hub] tutorial.

2. Replace the **connectCallback** function with the following code:

    ```nodejs
    var connectCallback = function (err) {
      if (err) {
        console.log('Could not connect: ' + err);
      } else {
        console.log('Client connected');
    
        // Create a message and send it to the IoT Hub every second
        setInterval(function(){
    	var data, message;
    	if (Math.random() > 0.7) {
    		if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
                data = "This is a critical message.";
                message = new Message(data);
                message.properties.add("level", "critical");
	        } else {
	            data = "This is a storage message.";
	            message = new Message(data);
                message.properties.add("level", "storage");
            }
            console.log("Sending message: " + message.getData());
    	}
    	else {
            	var temperature = 20 + (Math.random() * 15);
            	var humidity = 60 + (Math.random() * 20);            
            	data = JSON.stringify({ deviceId: 'myFirstNodeDevice', temperature: temperature, humidity: humidity });
            	message = new Message(data);
            	message.properties.add('temperatureAlert', (temperature > 30) ? 'true' : 'false');
            	console.log("Sending message: " + message.getData());
            }
    	client.sendEvent(message, printResultFor('send'));
        }, 1000);
      }
    };
    ```
   
    This method randomly adds the property `"level": "critical"` and `"level": "storage"` to messages sent by the device, which simulates a message that requires immediate action by the application back-end or one that needs to be permanently stored. The application supports routing messages based on message body.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > You can use message properties to route messages for various scenarios including cold-path processing, in addition to the hot path example shown here.

2. Save and close the **simulateddevice\SimulatedDevice.js** file.

    > [!NOTE]
    > We strongly recommend that you implement a retry policy such as exponential backoff, as suggested in the MSDN article [Transient Fault Handling].

## Add Service Bus queue to your IoT hub and route messages to it

In this section, you create a Service Bus queue, connect it to your IoT hub, and configure your IoT hub to send messages to the queue based on the presence of a property on the message. For more information about how to process messages from Service Bus queues, see [Get started with queues][lnk-sb-queues-node].

1. Create a Service Bus queue as described in [Get started with queues][lnk-sb-queues-node]. Make a note of the namespace and queue name.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Service Bus queues and topics used as IoT Hub endpoints must not have **Sessions** or **Duplicate Detection** enabled. If either of those options are enabled, the endpoint appears as **Unreachable** in the Azure portal.

2. In the Azure portal, open your IoT hub and click **Endpoints**.

    ![Endpoints in IoT hub][30]

3. In the **Endpoints** blade, click **Add** at the top to add your queue to your IoT hub. Name the endpoint **CriticalQueue** and use the drop-downs to select **Service Bus queue**, the Service Bus namespace in which your queue resides, and the name of your queue. When you are done, click **OK** at the bottom.  

    ![Adding an endpoint][31]

4. Now click **Routes** in your IoT Hub. Click **Add** at the top of the blade to create a routing rule that routes messages to the queue you just added. Select **Device Messages** as the source of data. Enter `level="critical"` as the condition, and choose **CriticalQueue** as a custom endpoint as the routing rule endpoint. Click **Save** at the bottom.  

    ![Adding a route][32]

    Make sure the fallback route is set to **ON**. This setting is the default configuration of an IoT hub.

    ![Fallback route][33]

## (Optional) Read from the queue endpoint

In this section, you create a Node.js console app that reads critical messages from IoT Service Bus. See further information in [Get started with queues][lnk-sb-queues-node]. 

1. Create an empty folder called `readcriticalqueue`. In the `readcriticalqueue` folder, create a package.json file using the following command at your command prompt. Accept all the defaults:

    ```cmd/sh
    npm init
    ```

2. At your command prompt in the `readcriticalqueue` folder, run the following command to install the **azure** package:

    ```cmd/sh
    npm install azure --save
    ```

3. Using a text editor, create a **ReadCriticalQueue.js** file in the `readcriticalqueue` folder.

4. Add the following `require` statements at the start of the **ReadCriticalQueue.js** file:

    ```nodejs
    'use strict';

    var azure = require('azure');
    ```

5. Add the following variable declaration and replace the placeholder values with the IoT Service Bus connection string and queue name:

    ```nodejs
    var connectionString = '{iotservicebus connection string}';
    var queueName = '{iotservice bus queue name}';
    ```

6. Add the following two functions that print output to the console:

    ```nodejs
    var serviceBusService = azure.createServiceBusService(connectionString);

    setInterval(function() {serviceBusService.receiveQueueMessage(queueName, function(error, receivedMessage) {
        if(!error){
            // Message received and deleted
    	    console.log(receivedMessage);
        } else { console.log(error); }
    	});
    }, 3000);
    ```

7. Save and close the **ReadCriticalQueue.js** file.

## Run the applications

Now you are ready to run the three applications.

1. To run the **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages.js** application, in a command prompt or shell navigate to the readdevicetocloudmessages folder and execute the following command:

   ```cmd/sh
   node ReadDeviceToCloudMessages.js
   ```

   ![Run read-d2c-messages][readd2c]

2. To run the **ReadCriticalQueue.js** application, in a command prompt or shell navigate to the readcriticalqueue folder and execute the following command:

   ```cmd/sh
   node ReadCriticalQueue.js
   ```
   
   ![Run read-critical-messages][readqueue]

3. To run the **SimulatedDevice.js** app, in a command prompt or shell navigate to the simulateddevice folder and execute the following command:

   ```cmd/sh
   node SimulatedDevice.js
   ```
   
   ![Run simulated-device][simulateddevice]

## (Optional) Add Storage Container to your IoT hub and route messages to it

In this section, you create a Storage account, connect it to your IoT hub, and configure your IoT hub to send messages to the account based on the presence of a property on the message. For more information about how to manage storage, see [Get started with Azure Storage][Azure Storage].

 > [!NOTE]
   > If you are not limited to one **Endpoint**, you may setup the **StorageContainer** in addition to the **CriticalQueue** and run both simulatneously.

1. Create a Storage account as described in [Azure Storage Documentation][lnk-storage]. Make a note of the account name.

2. In the Azure portal, open your IoT hub and click **Endpoints**.

3. In the **Endpoints** blade, select the **CriticalQueue** endpoint, and click **Delete**. Click **Yes**, and then click **Add**. Name the endpoint **StorageContainer** and use the drop-downs to select **Azure Storage Container**, and create a **Storage account** and a **Storage container**.  Make note of the names.  When you are done, click **OK** at the bottom. 

 > [!NOTE]
   > If you are not limited to one **Endpoint**, you do not need to delete the **CriticalQueue**.

4. Click **Routes** in your IoT Hub. Click **Add** at the top of the blade to create a routing rule that routes messages to the queue you just added. Select **Device Messages** as the source of data. Enter `level="storage"` as the condition, and choose **StorageContainer** as a custom endpoint as the routing rule endpoint. Click **Save** at the bottom.  

    Make sure the fallback route is set to **ON**. This setting is the default configuration of an IoT hub.

1. Make sure your previous application **SimulatedDevice.js** is still running. 

1. In the Azure Portal, go to your storage account, under **Blob Service**, click **Browse blobs...**.  Select your container, navigate to and click the JSON file, and click **Download** to view the data.
