# Migrating your on-premises workloads to Azure


Microsoft Azure provides access to a comprehensive set of cloud services that, as developers and IT professionals, you use to build, deploy, and manage applications on a range of tools and frameworks, through a global network of datacenters. As your business faces challenges associated with the digital shift, the Azure cloud helps you to figure out how to optimize resources and operations, engage with your customers and employees, and transform your products.

However, Azure recognizes that even with all the advantages that the cloud provides in terms of speed and flexibility, minimized costs, performance, and reliability, many organizations are going to need to run on-premises datacenters for some time to come. In response to cloud adoption barriers, Azure provides a hybrid cloud strategy that builds bridges between your on-premises datacenters, and the Azure public cloud. For example, using Azure cloud resources like backup to protect on-premises resources, or using Azure analytics to gain insights into on-premises workloads. 

As part of our hybrid cloud strategy, Azure provides growing solutions for migrating on-premises apps and workloads to the cloud. With simple steps, you can comprehensively assess your on-premises resources to figure out how they'll run in the Azure cloud. Then, with a deep assessment in hand, you can confidently migrate resources to Azure. When resources are up and running in Azure, you can optimize them to retain and improve access, flexibility, security, and reliability.

This series of migration articles shows you how you can plan and build a migration strategy for your company. The articles illustrate a number of scenarios of increasing complexity, that we'll add to over time. These scenarios are summarized in the table below. For each scenario we provide an overview, a migration architecture, and demonstrate the steps involved in the migration process.
