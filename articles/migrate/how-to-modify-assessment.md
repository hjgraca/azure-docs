# Customize an assessment

[Azure Migrate](migrate-overview.md) creates assessments with default properties. After creating an assessment, you can modify the default properties using the instructions in this article.


## Edit assessment properties

1. In the **Assessments** page of the migration project, select the assessment, and click **Edit properties**.
2. Modify the properties in accordance with the following table:

    **Setting** | **Details** | **Default**
    --- | --- | ---
    **Target location** | The Azure location to which you want to migrate.<br/><br/> Azure Migrate currently supports 30 regions including Australia East, Australia Southeast, Brazil South, Canada Central, Canada East, Central India, Central US, China East, China North, East Asia, East US, Germany Central, Germany Northeast, East US 2, Japan East, Japan West, Korea Central, Korea South, North Central US, North Europe, South Central US, Southeast Asia, South India, UK South, UK West, US Gov Arizona, US Gov Texas, US Gov Virginia, West Central US, West Europe, West India, West US, and West US2. |  West US 2 is the default location.
    **Storage redundancy** | The type of storage redundancy that the Azure VMs will use after migration. | [Locally redundant storage (LRS)](../storage/common/storage-redundancy-lrs.md) is the default value. Azure Migrate only supports managed disks-based assessments and managed disks only support LRS, hence the property currently only has the LRS option.
    **Sizing criterion** | The criterion to be used by Azure Migrate to right-size VMs for Azure. You can do either do *performance-based* sizing or size the VMs *as on-premises*, without considering the performance history. | Performance-based sizing is the default option.
    **Performance history** | The duration to consider for evaluating the performance of the VMs. This property is only applicable when sizing criterion is *performance-based sizing*. | Default is one day.
    **Percentile utilization** | The percentile value of the performance sample set to be considered for right-sizing. This property is only applicable when sizing criterion is *performance-based sizing*.  | Default is 95th percentile.
    **VM series** | You can specify the VM series that you would like to consider for right-sizing. For example, if you have a production environment that you do not plan to migrate to A-series VMs in Azure, you can exclude A-series from the list or series and the right-sizing will be done only in the selected series. | By default, all VM series are selected.
    **Pricing tier** | You can specify the [pricing tier (Basic/Standard)](../virtual-machines/windows/sizes-general.md) for the target Azure VMs. For example, if you are planning to migrate a production environment, you would like to consider the Standard tier, which provides VMs with low latency but may cost more. On the other hand, if you have a Dev-Test environment, you may want to consider the Basic tier that has VMs with higher latency and lower costs. | By default the [Standard](../virtual-machines/windows/sizes-general.md) tier is used.
    **Comfort factor** | Azure Migrate considers a buffer (comfort factor) during assessment. This buffer is applied on top of machine utilization data for VMs (CPU, memory, disk, and network). The comfort factor accounts for issues such as seasonal usage, short performance history, and likely increases in future usage.<br/><br/> For example, 10-core VM with 20% utilization normally results in a 2-core VM. However, with a comfort factor of 2.0x, the result is a 4-core VM instead. | Default setting is 1.3x.
    **Offer** | [Azure Offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/offer-details/) that you are enrolled to. | [Pay-as-you-go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) is the default.
    **Currency** | Billing currency. | Default is US dollars.
    **Discount (%)** | Any subscription-specific discount you receive on top of the Azure offer. | The default setting is 0%.
    **Azure Hybrid Benefit** | Specify if you have software assurance and are eligible for [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-use-benefit/). If set to Yes, non-Windows Azure prices are considered for Windows VMs. | Default is Yes.

3. Click **Save** to update the assessment.
