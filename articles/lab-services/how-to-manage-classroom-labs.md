# Manage classroom labs in Azure Lab Services (formerly Azure DevTest Labs)
This article describes how to create and configure a classroom lab, view all classroom labs, or delete a classroom lab.

## Create a classroom lab

1. Navigate to [Azure Lab Services website](https://labs.azure.com).
2. In the **New Lab** window, do the following actions: 
    1. Specify a **name** for the classroom lab. 
    2. Select the **size** of the virtual machine that you plan to use in the classroom.
    3. Select the **image** to use to create the virtual machine.
    4. Specify the **default credentials** to use for logging into the virtual machines in the lab.
    7. Select **Save**.

1. You see the **home page** for the lab.

## Configure usage policy

1. Select **Usage policy**. 
2. In the **Usage policy**, settings, enter the **number of users** allowed to use the lab.
3. Select **Save**.

## Set up the template
A template in a lab is from which all users’ virtual machines are created. Set up the template virtual machine so that it is configured with exactly what you want to provide to the lab users. You can provide a name and description of the template that the lab users see, and set the visibility to “Public” to make instances of the template VM available to your lab users.  

## Set template title and description
1. In the **Template** section, select **Edit** (pencil icon) for the template. 
2. In the **User view** window, Enter a **title** for the template.
3. Enter **description** for the template.
4. Select **Save**.

### Make instances of the template public 
Once you set the visibility of a template to **Public**, Azure Lab Services creates VMs in the lab by using the template. The number of VMs created in this process are the same as the maximum number of users allowed into the lab, which you can set in the usage policy of the lab. All virtual machines have the same configuration as the template.  

1. Select **Visibility** in the **Template** section. 
2. In the **Availability** page, select **Public**.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Once a template is publicly available, its access can't be changed to private. 
3. Select **Save**.

## Send registration link to students

1. Select **User registration** tile.
2. In the **User registration** dialog box, select the **Copy** button. The link is copied to the clipboard. Paste it in an email editor, and send an email to the student.

## View all classroom labs
1. Navigate to [Azure Lab Services portal](https://labs.azure.com).
2. Confirm that you see all the labs in the selected lab account. 

    ![All labs](./media/how-to-manage-classroom-labs/all-labs.png)
3. Use the drop-down list at the top to select a different lab account. You see labs in the selected lab account. 

## Delete a classroom lab
1. On the tile for the lab, select three dots (...) in the corner.

2. Select **Delete**.
