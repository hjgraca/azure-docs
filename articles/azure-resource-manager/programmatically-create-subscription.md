# Programmatically create Azure Enterprise subscriptions (preview)

As an Azure customer on [Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/), you can create EA (MS-AZR-0017P) and EA Dev/Test (MS-AZR-0148P) subscriptions programmatically. To give another user or service principal the permission to create subscriptions billed to your account, give them [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](../active-directory/role-based-access-control-configure.md) access to your enrollment account. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure subscription(s) created via this API are governed by the agreement under which you have obtained Microsoft Azure services from Microsoft or an authorized reseller. To learn more, see [Microsoft Azure Legal Information](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/).

In this article you will:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Learn how to create subscriptions programmatically using Azure Resource Manager
> * Understand how to use RBAC to share the ability to create subscriptions billed to your EA account

Also, see the [.NET sample code on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/create-azure-subscription-dotnet-core).

## Ask your EA Enrollment Admin to add you as Account Owner

To begin, ask your Enrollment Administrator to [add you as an Account Owner in using the EA portal](https://ea.azure.com/helpdocs/addNewAccount) (log-in required). Follow the instructions in the invitation email you receive to manually create an initial subscription.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must confirm account ownership and manually create an initial EA subscription before proceeding to the next step. Just adding the account to the enrollment is not enough.

## Find accounts you have access to

After you're added to an Azure EA enrollment as an Account Owner, Azure uses the account-to-enrollment relationship to determine where to bill the subscription charges. To create subscriptions, first find out what enrollment accounts you have access to. If you're currently an EA Account Owner and you try to use this API, Azure checks for the following conditions:

- Your account has been added to an EA enrollment
- You have one or more EA or EA Dev/Test subscriptions, meaning that you've gone through manual sign-up at least once
- You're logged into the Account Owner's *home directory*, which is the directory that subscriptions are created in by default

If the above three conditions are met, an `enrollmentAccount` resource is returned and you can start creating subscriptions under that account. All subscriptions created under the account are billed towards the EA enrollment that the account is in.

# [REST](#tab/rest)

Request to list all enrollment accounts:

```json
GET https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/enrollmentAccounts?api-version=2018-03-01-preview
```

Azure responds with a list of all enrollment accounts you have access to:

```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/enrollmentAccounts/747ddfe5-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "name": "747ddfe5-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "type": "Microsoft.Billing/enrollmentAccounts",
      "properties": {
        "principalName": "SignUpEngineering@contoso.com"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/enrollmentAccounts/4cd2fcf6-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "name": "4cd2fcf6-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "type": "Microsoft.Billing/enrollmentAccounts",
      "properties": {
        "principalName": "BillingPlatformTeam@contoso.com"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-powershell.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-powershell.md)]

Use the [Get-AzureRmEnrollmentAccount command](/powershell/module/azurerm.billing/get-azurermenrollmentaccount) to list all enrollment accounts you have access to.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzureRmEnrollmentAccount
```

Azure responds with a list of the Object IDs and email addresses of accounts.

```azurepowershell
ObjectId                               | PrincipalName
747ddfe5-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx   | SignUpEngineering@contoso.com
4cd2fcf6-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx   | BillingPlatformTeam@contoso.com
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

Use the [az billing enrollment-account list](https://aka.ms/EASubCreationPublicPreviewCLI) command to list all enrollment accounts you have access to.

```azurecli-interactive 
az billing enrollment-account list
```
Azure responds with a list of the Object IDs and email addresses of accounts.

```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/enrollmentAccounts/747ddfe5-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "name": "747ddfe5-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "type": "Microsoft.Billing/enrollmentAccounts",
      "properties": {
        "principalName": "SignUpEngineering@contoso.com"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/enrollmentAccounts/747ddfe5-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "name": "4cd2fcf6-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "type": "Microsoft.Billing/enrollmentAccounts",
      "properties": {
        "principalName": "BillingPlatformTeam@contoso.com"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

Use the `principalName` property to identify the account that you want subscriptions to be billed to. Use the `id` as the `enrollmentAccount` value that you use to create the subscription in the next step.

## Create subscriptions under a specific enrollment account 

The following example creates a request to create subscription named *Dev Team Subscription* and subscription offer is *MS-AZR-0017P* (regular EA). The enrollment account is `747ddfe5-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` (placeholder value, this is a GUID), which is the enrollment account for SignUpEngineering@contoso.com. It also optionally adds two users as RBAC Owners for the subscription.

# [REST](#tab/rest)

Use the `id` of the `enrollmentAccount` in the path of the request to create subscription.

```json
POST https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/enrollmentAccounts/747ddfe5-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.Subscription/createSubscription?api-version=2018-03-01-preview

{
  "displayName": "Dev Team Subscription",
  "offerType": "MS-AZR-0017P",
  "owners": [
    {
      "objectId": "<userObjectId>"
    },
    {
      "objectId": "<servicePrincipalObjectId>"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Delegate access to an enrollment account using RBAC

To give another user or service principal the ability to create subscriptions against a specific account, [give them an RBAC Owner role at the scope of the enrollment account](../active-directory/role-based-access-control-manage-access-rest.md). The following example gives a user in the tenant with `principalId` of `<userObjectId>` (for SignUpEngineering@contoso.com) an Owner role on the enrollment account. 

# [REST](#tab/rest)

```json
PUT  https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/enrollmentAccounts/747ddfe5-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/<roleAssignmentGuid>?api-version=2015-07-01

{
  "properties": {
    "roleDefinitionId": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/enrollmentAccounts/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/<ownerRoleDefinitionId>",
    "principalId": "<userObjectId>"
  }
}
```
When the Owner role is successfully assigned at the enrollment account scope, Azure responds with information of the role assignment:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "roleDefinitionId": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/enrollmentAccounts/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/<ownerRoleDefinitionId>",
    "principalId": "<userObjectId>",
    "scope": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/enrollmentAccounts/747ddfe5-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "createdOn": "2018-03-05T08:36:26.4014813Z",
    "updatedOn": "2018-03-05T08:36:26.4014813Z",
    "createdBy": "<assignerObjectId>",
    "updatedBy": "<assignerObjectId>"
  },
  "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/enrollmentAccounts/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/<ownerRoleDefinitionId>",
  "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments",
  "name": "<roleAssignmentGuid>"
}
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Use the [New-AzureRmRoleAssignment](../active-directory/role-based-access-control-manage-access-powershell.md) to give another user Owner access to your enrollment account.

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzureRmRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName Owner -ObjectId <userObjectId> -Scope /providers/Microsoft.Billing/enrollmentAccounts/747ddfe5-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Use the [az role assignment create](../active-directory/role-based-access-control-manage-access-azure-cli.md) to give another user Owner access to your enrollment account.

```azurecli-interactive 
az role assignment create --role Owner --assignee-object-id <userObjectId> --scope /providers/Microsoft.Billing/enrollmentAccounts/747ddfe5-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

----

Once a user becomes an RBAC Owner for your enrollment account, they can programmatically create subscriptions under it. A subscription created by a delegated user still has the original Account Owner as Service Admin, but it also has the delegated user as an Owner by default. 

## Audit who created subscriptions using activity logs

To track the subscriptions created via this API, use the [Tenant Activity Log API](/rest/api/monitor/tenantactivitylogs). It's currently not possible to use PowerShell, CLI, or Azure portal to track subscription creation.

1. As a tenant admin of the Azure AD tenant, [elevate access](../active-directory/role-based-access-control-tenant-admin-access.md) then assign a Reader role to the auditing user over the scope `/providers/microsoft.insights/eventtypes/management`.
1. As the auditing user, call the [Tenant Activity Log API](/rest/api/monitor/tenantactivitylogs) to see subscription creation activities. Example:

```
GET "/providers/Microsoft.Insights/eventtypes/management/values?api-version=2015-04-01&$filter=eventTimestamp ge '{greaterThanTimeStamp}' and eventTimestamp le '{lessThanTimestamp}' and eventChannels eq 'Operation' and resourceProvider eq 'Microsoft.Subscription'" 
```

> [!NOTE]
> To conveniently call this API from the command line, try [ARMClient](https://github.com/projectkudu/ARMClient).

## Limitations of Azure Enterprise subscription creation API

- Only Azure Enterprise subscriptions can be created using this API.
- There's a limit of 50 subscriptions per account. After that, subscriptions can only be created by using Account Center.
- There needs to be at least one EA or EA Dev/Test subscriptions under the account, which means the Account Owner has gone through manual sign-up at least once.
- Users who aren't Account Owners, but were added to an enrollment account via RBAC, cannot create subscriptions using Account Center.
- You cannot select the tenant for the subscription to be created in. The subscription is always created in the home tenant of the Account Owner. To move the subscription to a different tenant, see [change subscription tenant](..\active-directory\active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory.md).
