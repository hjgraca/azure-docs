For local development in Azure Functions version2.x, the package is used to [register the binding extension](../articles/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings.md#local-development-azure-functions-core-tools). For C# class library development in Functions 1.x and 2.x, support for the binding is added by [installing the package](../articles/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings.md#local-c-development-using-visual-studio-or-vs-code).

Note that source code follows WebJobs SDK version numbering: WebJobs SDK version 2.x is equivalent to Azure Functions 1.x, so Functions 1.x code is in the v2.x branch in the repository. Master and dev branches contain code for Web Jobs 3.x, which is the same as Functions 2.x.
