If the volume container has associated volumes, take those volumes offline first. Follow the steps in [Take a volume offline](../articles/storsimple/storsimple-8000-manage-volumes-u2.md#take-a-volume-offline). After the volumes are offline, you can delete them. When the volume container has no associated volumes, delete the volume container. Perform the following procedure to delete a volume container.

#### To delete a volume container
